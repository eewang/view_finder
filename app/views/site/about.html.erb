        <p>Hailing from the flat farmlands of the midwest, Jesse sought to immerse himself in the energy and creativity of New York, which he now calls home.  Before learning Ruby, Jesse was a NYC Teaching Fellow for 3 years, where he taught math to students with learning disabilities. He started an after-school robotics class re-kindled his early interest in computers, that stems back from when BBS was the hot new thing. Attending The Flatiron School was a great way for Jesse to learn full-stack development in a collaborative environment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Jesse is passionate about working on projects that creatively engage users and deliver a lot of functionality in a simple package.</p>

        <p>You know that girl one table over standing on the chair, taking an Instagram shot of her appetizer? Yeah, that's me. I'm a habitual collector. A collector of travel experiences, candid photos, the latest iPad apps, memorable quotes, and Groupon deals.</p>
        
        <p>My abiding curiosity and love of discovery took me from a B.A. in
        Economics at Northwestern University to a year and a half in India traveling and working with children of the red-light district.</p>
        
        <p>Having spent the next three years working as a tax accountant, I knew I needed to be a creator, be a builder of beautiful solutions.</p>
