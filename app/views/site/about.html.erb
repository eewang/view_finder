    <div class="span8">
      <p>Hailing from the flat farmlands of the midwest, Jesse sought to immerse himself in the energy and creativity of New York, which he now calls home.  Before learning Ruby, Jesse was a NYC Teaching Fellow for 3 years, where he taught math to students with learning disabilities. Starting an after-school robotics class re-kindled his early interest in computers, which started back when BBS was the hot new thing. Attending The Flatiron School was a great way for Jesse to learn full-stack development in a collaborative environment.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Jesse is passionate about working on projects that creatively engage users and deliver a lot of functionality in a simple package.</p>
